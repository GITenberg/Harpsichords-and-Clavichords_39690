<h2><i>Harpsichords and Clavichords</i></h2>

<p>The harpsichord and the clavichord represent the two most
important types of stringed keyboard instruments used from
the 15th through the 18th centuries. By the 19th century, the
piano had become the most important domestic keyboard
instrument.</p>

<p>In this booklet are described a few of the restored Smithsonian
harpsichords and clavichords that are occasionally on
exhibit in the Hall of Musical Instruments or in use in the
series of concerts sponsored by the Division of Musical Instruments.
Models showing how the sound is produced on these
instruments are also on exhibit.</p>

<p>A complete list of the keyboard collection is found in
<i>A Checklist of Keyboard Instruments at the Smithsonian Institution</i>
(Washington, 1967), which is available from the Division of
Musical Instruments, Smithsonian Institution, Washington ,D.C. 20560.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p class="heading"><i>Harpsichords</i></p>

<p>The harpsichord and its smaller relatives, the virginal and
the spinet, have strings that are <i>plucked</i>. The harpsichord is
wing-shaped, most virginals and spinets are either rectangular
or polygonal.</p>

<p>When the harpsichord key is pressed, a wooden jack is
raised so that a quill or leather plectrum inserted into the jack
tongue plucks the string. When the key is released, the jack
falls back into place, the pivoted tongue allowing the plectrum
to pass the string without plucking it. A felt damper (inserted
in a slit at the top of the jack) touches the string to stop the
sound.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the jack arrangement in an 18th century
English spinet. The second jack from the left on the front row
has been raised so that its quill is just about to pluck the
string. Note that the quill has lifted the string above its rest
position.</p>

<p>Inherent in the design of a harpsichord is the limitation of
dynamic nuance. The sound of a harpsichord is not greatly
altered by increasing or lessening the impact of fingers on the
keys. Rather, the dynamic level and quality of sound can be
changed by varying the number of strings plucked (many harpsichords
have three sets of strings: two sets tuned in unison [8&#8242;]
and a third tuned an octave higher [4&#8242;]), by varying the location
of the plucking point, and by muting the strings with felt
or leather pads.</p>

<p>The tone of a keyboard instrument is also affected by its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>general outline, the material and thickness of the soundboard,
the length and material of the strings, and the type of case
construction. The case must be strong enough to counteract the
tension of the strings and yet light enough to allow the sound to
resonate.</p>

<p>Among the Smithsonian&#8217;s extensive keyboard collection are
fine examples of harpsichords that represent several of the major
national trends in harpsichord building: the Flemish, Italian,
English, and French.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p class="heading"><i>Flemish Harpsichords</i></p>

<p>Antwerp was the harpsichord-making center of northern
Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. The earliest
examples of harpsichords had only one keyboard and one or
two sets of 8&#8242; strings. The progressive Flemish makers added
a second keyboard and another set of strings, tuned an octave
higher than the others, which allowed a wider range in pitch
and more variety in sound. Later French and English harpsichords
were largely derived from the Flemish style.</p>

<p>Instruments built by the famous Ruckers family were and are
still highly prized. Although simply painted on the exterior,
the case of this virginal is decorated on the inside in characteristic
Ruckers style. Block-printed papers cover the interior
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of the case; the inside of the lid bears a Latin motto and the
soundboard is painted with flowers and arabesques. Figure 4
illustrates a detail of the block printing, and of the keys. The
arcades on the end of the keys appear to be cut from several
layers of leather which were then applied to the key fronts.</p>

<p>This instrument is tuned a fourth higher than it might
appear. When the C key is pressed, the note sounded is F,
a fourth above.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Short-Octave Tuning</i></p>

<p>Since chromatic notes in the lowest octave of the keyboard
were not often needed in the music of the 16th and 17th
centuries, the practice of short-octave tuning was adopted.</p>

<p>Although the lowest note on a short-octave instrument
appears to be E, the range was actually extended down to
C. (The notation C/E indicates this arrangement.)</p>

<p>Typical of northern European instruments, the Dulcken
harpsichord has a heavy case, two keyboards or manuals,
and two 8&#8242; choirs and one 4&#8242; choir. It also has a lute stop,
whose jacks, very close to the nut, pluck one set of unison
strings to produce a pungent, nasal tone.</p>

<p class="heading"><i>Italian Harpsichords</i></p>

<p>Typical Italian harpsichords had two choirs of unison strings
and two jacks for each key. They were of much lighter construction
than those made in northern Europe&mdash;the sides of
the case were only about an eighth of an inch thick. These
fragile instruments were usually placed in heavier, often
elaborately decorated, outer cases from which the harpsichord
could be removed.</p>

<p class="tb">Harpsichord, <i>1693; maker unknown, Italy
One manual; Range GG-c<sup>3</sup> (no GG<sup>&#9839;</sup>); 2&times;8</i>&#8242;</p>

<p>The typical construction of Italian harpsichords can be seen
in this large Italian instrument. The original nameboard is
missing; however, as was common practice, the maker marked
the date on the tail of the lowest and highest keys.</p>

<p>The Italian harpsichord serves as an ideal <i>basso continuo</i>
keyboard instrument because it blends well in instrumental
combinations. Its clean, crisp sound also allows individual
lines to emerge clearly from a polyphonic musical texture.</p>

<p>This instrument is one of the few examples of an Italian
harpsichord with a third set of strings tuned an octave higher
than the two unison choirs. It is possible that the third set
was added to this instrument sometime after it was constructed
with two unison registers.</p>

<p class="tb">Virginal, 1617; <i>made by Giovanni Battista Boni, Cortona
One manual; Range C/E-f<sup>3</sup>; 1&times;8</i>&#8242;</p>

<p>The smaller virginals and spinets were commonly found in
homes of modest means, as well as in royal courts. This polygonal
virginal has six split keys which represent a complicated
tuning scheme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i_022" id="i_022"></a><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="500" height="131"
alt="Tuning scheme." /></div>

<p>Keys 1-2: This is a system of short-octave tuning (see Ruckers
Virginal) in which the two lowest accidentals are split into two
sections. The back section is tuned to the apparent accidental,
the front section to the short octave. Thus, on the Boni, the
back section of the bottom split key is tuned F<sup>&#9839;</sup>, the front
section is tuned D; the back section of the second lowest split
key is tuned A<sup>&#9837;</sup>, the front section is tuned E.</p>

<p>Keys 3-6: The top four keys are split to provide for enharmonic
tuning&mdash;that is, both D<sup>&#9839;</sup> and E<sup>&#9837;</sup>, G<sup>&#9839;</sup> and A<sup>&#9837;</sup>. In the
meantone system of tuning, which was the prevailing tuning of
the time, scales distant from the key of C were often out of tune.
To improve the intonation of these scales, some makers divided
some of the accidental keys to provide alternate tunings.</p>

<p class="heading"><i>English Harpsichords</i></p>

<p>In the 18th century, London became a center of harpsichord
making. The two most important makers, Jacob Kirckman
and Burkat Shudi, were Swiss immigrants who first apprenticed
with Hermann Tabel, a Flemish harpsichord maker who had
also emigrated to England. In America, where English culture
was highly regarded, Thomas Jefferson owned a Kirckman
harpsichord, Francis Hopkinson a Shudi and Broadwood.</p>

<p>The heavy cases of the typical English instruments were
veneered in walnut, mahogany, and later satinwood, and
rested on trestle stands. The usual range was five octaves:
FF-f<sup>3</sup> for harpsichords; GG-g<sup>3</sup> for spinets (and organs).
In general, the sound produced on an English harpsichord is
more thick and lush than the sound of instruments from other
European centers.</p>

<p class="tb">Spinet, <i>about 1710; made by Thomas Hitchcock, London
One manual; Range GG-g<sup>3</sup>; 1&times;8&#8242;</i></p>

<p>The spinet, a member of the harpsichord family, was a popular
domestic keyboard instrument in England and America
during the 18th century and was mentioned in many American
diaries and inventories of that time. The spinet often served
as the keyboard instrument for the household that could not
afford or did not have room for the harpsichord or organ.</p>

<p>The Hitchcock family supplied many spinets for early 18th-century
gentility. Note in Figure 24 the handsome brass
hinges, one of many examples of the beautiful hardware used
by English builders. This instrument is quilled with crow quill,
the most common material used for plectra at that time. A
detail of the jacks and stringing is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="tb">Harpsichord, <i>about 1743; made by Burkat Shudi, London
Two manuals; Range FF-f<sup>3</sup> (no FF<sup>&#9839;</sup>; 2&times;8&#8242;, 1&times;4&#8242;, lute, buff</i></p>

<p>Most of the stops on early harpsichords were changed by hand.
From left to right, the stop knobs shown in Figure 25 operate
the following registers: <i>lute</i>, <i>octave</i> (4&#8242;), <i>buff</i> (muting the second
unison by pressing soft leather pads against the strings), <i>first
unison</i> (8&#8242;), and <i>second unison</i> (8&#8242;). The lute stop plays from the
upper manual, the first unison from both manuals, and the
remaining stops from the lower manual.</p>

<p>Figures 25 and 26 show the instrument before restoration.
The name batten on which the date of 1747 appears is not
original to the instrument. The date of the instrument is based
on the serial number 144 stamped on the lower keyboard.
From all records it appears Shudi would have built an
instrument with that serial number in 1743.</p>

<p class="heading"><i>French Harpsichords</i></p>

<p>Although Paris claimed many harpsichord builders, few French
harpsichords remain today. Many were destroyed at the time of
the Revolution and later when firewood was needed to heat
Conservatoire classrooms.</p>

<p>French builders, the most famous among them the Blanchet
family and Pascal Taskin, spent much of their time reconstructing
Ruckers harpsichords to satisfy the musical and decorative
tastes of 18th-century France. Included in this reconstruction
or <i>ravalement</i> were the extension of compass (usually from C-c<sup>3</sup>
to FF-f<sup>3</sup>), enlargement of the case and soundboard, and often
replacement of keyboards, jacks, and registers.</p>

<p>Housed in elegantly painted cases supported by cabriole or
fluted legs, typical French harpsichords had two manuals and
were praised for their lightness of touch. Later 18th-century
developments included a fourth register called <i>peau de buffle</i>
(plectra of soft chamois-type leather) and knee levers to operate
the registers.</p>

<p class="tb">Harpsichord, <i>1760; made by Benoist Stehlin, Paris
Two manuals; Range FF-f<sup>3</sup>; 2&times;8&#8242;, 1&times;4&#8242;, buff, shove coupler</i></p>

<p>In recent years the Smithsonian was fortunate to acquire one
of the few remaining French harpsichords. The builder&#8217;s
name is known from the design on the soundboard rose which
includes the initials &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221;; also, the name &#8220;Benoist
Stehlin&#8221; is inscribed on two of the jacks. The 1760 date is
painted on the left side of the soundboard. An inventory of
Stehlin&#8217;s workshop and house made at the time of his death
in 1774 lists a Ruckers harpsichord altered by Stehlin along
with several other instruments in various stages of completion.
Figures 28 and 30 show the instrument before its restoration.</p>

<p>This instrument was restored to playing condition in the
conservation laboratory of the Division of Musical Instruments
in 1968. Typical of most French instruments, it is equipped
with a shove coupler, which enables the player to operate
both manuals from the lower keyboard by shoving the upper
keyboard away from him. In this pushed-back position, wooden
uprights (dogs) attached to the upper surface of the far ends
of the lower key levers couple the two manuals and cause the
upper manual keys to descend when the lower manual keys
are pressed.</p>

<p class="heading"><i>Clavichords</i></p>

<p>Dynamic shadings are possible in the clavichord, as in the
piano, through variation of finger pressure. In both, the
strings are struck&mdash;by metal tangents in the clavichord and
by leather or felt hammers in the piano.</p>

<p>In the clavichord the strings extend over a soundboard
bridge on the player&#8217;s right and are damped (stopped from
vibrating) by strips of cloth on the left. The metal hammer
(tangent) mounted in the end of the key strikes the string
and continues to touch it as long as the player presses the
key. The tangent, while touching the string, divides it into
two segments&mdash;the segment on the right being free to vibrate,
the segment on the left being damped by the cloth. When
the key is released, the cloth damps the entire string.</p>

<p>Figure 31 shows a player depressing a clavichord key
(middle c). The tangent at the far end of the key lever has
been raised so that it has struck the strings and has lifted
them above rest position. The damping cloth on the left of
this raised string can also be seen.</p>

<p>Known as early as the 15th century, the clavichord produces
tones, though limited in volume, that are very expressive
and even capable of vibrato (<i>Bebung</i>). Because it lacks carrying
power, the clavichord historically was a solo or practice
instrument, for it could not be heard in combination with
other instruments or with the voice.</p>

<p class="tb">Fretted Clavichord, <i>about 1700; maker unknown, Germany</i>
Unfretted Clavichord, <i>18th century; maker unknown, Germany</i></p>

<p>The clavichord was usually housed in a rectangular case
which rested upon a simple stand. The range of the earlier
instruments was about four octaves. By the 18th century the
range had been expanded to five octaves.</p>

<p>The larger, later clavichords had separate strings for each
key and were unfretted or <i>bundfrei</i>. Many smaller and earlier
clavichords were fretted (<i>gebunden</i>), having some strings that
would produce more than one pitch when struck at different
points by adjacent keys.</p>

<p>Figure 32 shows the fretted clavichord keyboard in more
detail. Tangents on keys numbered 16 and 17 strike the same
strings to produce the notes e<sup>&#9837;</sup> and e. Some other fretted notes
shown in the picture include: keys 18 and 19 (f and f<sup>&#9839;</sup>),
keys 20 and 21 (g and g<sup>&#9839;</sup>), keys 23 and 24 (b<sup>&#9837;</sup> and b), and
keys 25 and 26 (middle c and c<sup>&#9839;</sup>). Figure 31 is also a detail
from this clavichord.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian clavichord shown in Figures 35 and 36,
in unrestored condition, is typical of the large unfretted instruments
that became standard in Germany by the mid-18th
century and for which Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote many
solo keyboard compositions.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 18th century the desire was strong
for a more expressive keyboard instrument to use in ensembles.
Harpsichord builders added new stops, devised special leather
plectra, and added Venetian swell effects and other innovations
to alter the sound of the harpsichord. But no matter what
they did, they could not produce enough dynamic gradation
to satisfy musical taste. The clavichord was capable of
dynamic nuance, but it lacked carrying power.</p>

<p>Instrument builders, seeking to satisfy the demands created
by the change in sensibility and musical taste, turned naturally
to the domestic instruments they knew best&mdash;the harpsichord
and clavichord&mdash;as the process of adaptation began. For this
reason, as the pianoforte was developed and perfected, the
general proportions and arrangement of the grand piano
resembled those of the harpsichord. Similarly, the relation
between the keyboard and strings, the scaling, and other
features of the square piano resembled those of the clavichord.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 19th century the pianoforte, an
instrument capable of subtle changes between soft and loud,
had become the most important domestic and concert keyboard
instrument. After 1800 few clavichords or harpsichords
were built or used until they were revived by early music
enthusiasts at the end of the 19th century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
